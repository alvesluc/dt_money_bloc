## About

This project was initially developed with React, in a event called Next Level Week, which is a intense week of free content with an amazing quality, then I've cloned it using Flutter with the same design that was first purposed, you can check it [here](https://github.com/alvesluc/dt_money).

Feature-wise, this is the same application, but now is fully tested and uses the combination of Material 3 and [Bloc](https://bloclibrary.dev/#/).
